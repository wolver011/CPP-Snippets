## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning the repository or contributing.
- [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or any other modern C++ compiler to compile and run the code snippets.

### Installation

To start using **CPP-Snippets**, you can clone the repository and access the collection of C++ files:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CPP-Snippets.git

### Usage

After installing the package, you can start using the snippets in your project:
```cpp
// Example: Using a binary search snippet
#include "binary_search.h"

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    int target = 4;
    int result = binary_search(arr, target);
    cout << "Index of target: " << result << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```
Explore other categories, such as sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, and more, by navigating through the folder structure.

### Example Snippets
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search in sorted arrays.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of quicksort, mergesort, and other commonly used sorting techniques.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra’s algorithm, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures such as heaps, stacks, queues, and graphs.
Check the documentation for details on each snippet's functionality and usage examples.
